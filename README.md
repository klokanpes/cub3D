# Description

cub3d is my current 42 Prague work-in-progress: a MiniLibX-based raycaster intended to recreate the classic Wolfenstein 3D-style experience, featuring player movement within a parsed map space, continuous tracking of position and heading vector, a fully functional player-centered minimap that scrolls with movement, and an on-screen FPS counter; the remaining major milestone is implementing the raycasting renderer, and the repository is published as a WIP to document ongoing development.

# CAUTION
- This project is a work in progress(WIP) and as such is not yet fully functional and pretty.
